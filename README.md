# Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

My first website. This website is based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles original arcade game attract screen. 

I have been told that somebody's very first website would not be pretty, no matter what. I embraced this by taking the colors of the High Scores list from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles attract screen, and made a linear gradient out of it. 

I was then able to copy the information from each of the turtles' profiles, and use Flexbox to add pictures of each turtle from the original cartoon TV series next to the profiles.

As an extra treat, there is a full gradient on smaller viewports or when viewed on a mobile device.
